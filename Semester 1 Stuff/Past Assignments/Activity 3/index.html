    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <h2>I'm Omzee Pitchford</h2>
    <p>I’m a strategy-driven designer focused on user experience, problem solving, and great interactions.

        My interest in design stems from my passion for gaming. Whether it’s a board game or a tactical shooter, I love
        pitting my wits against others in friendly competition. A hard-fought loss is better than an easy win!

        As a third culture kid, I have a great interest in learning the stories of others, and I find something to take
        away from every person I meet. Connect with me on LinkedIn!</p>
