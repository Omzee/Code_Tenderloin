    <h2>Cuteness</h2>
    <p>Froges are very cute you can tell by their big eyes (See: Eyes) and how they are smole and slimey.
        Some people don't like their slimeyness (See: Criticisms) but I disagree.
        Toades are a less cute variant of froges but they are pretty cool too I just wish they had less warts.</p>

    <h2>Color</h2>
    <p> Froges are mostly different shades of green so they can camofroge into their environment but sometimes they are
        pretty cool colors,
        to warn predators not to eat them because they are poisonous. </p>

    <h2>Eyes</h2>
    <p> Froges have big eyes that have a secondary eyelid that allows them to see underwater as if they had goggles. They also usually use the eyeballs to help them digest! 
        They close their eyes and push the food down their bodies with them. Froges are so cool. </p>

    <h2>Criticisms</h2>
    <p> Froges are pretty slimey and sometimes kind of gross but hair is much grosser than slimey skin and scales are worse so pretty much froges are the best anway.</p>
